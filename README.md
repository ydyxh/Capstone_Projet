# Capstone_Projet
## Scient is developing a virtual core laboratory to analyze drilling core images in both RGB and hyperspectral formats for geoscientist research purposes. The final goal of Scient aims to build an interface that permits users to visualize the spectrogram derived from piston core sediment sample cubes. Furthermore, it may also provide a non- destructive method for analyzing sediment samples from imagery data. Through this interface, geologists and researchers can compare the drilled core samples with known references from a spectral library, utilize predefined or standard workflows to identify the mineral composition and measure the fractional abundance of pore fluid or target minerals.
## This project aims to facilitate early-stage exploration by allowing remote analysis of extensive core image datasets. Specifically, our group mainly focuses on the drilled sample mineral component analysis through a deep learning approach, which is a part of the back-end development of the interface. Therefore, our primary objective is to digitize core assets and provide a dynamic interface to characterize lithological composition on a large scale, thereby enhancing the value and return on investment for costly drilling operations and physical sample storage.
